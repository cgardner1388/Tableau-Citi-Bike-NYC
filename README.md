## What is the trend with bike rentals in relation to age? Which age group is renting the most bikes? 
Based on the chart in sheet “Ride Count by Age”; people who are between the ages of 30 to 40 are renting the bikes the most out of all of the other age groups. The older the age, the lower the number of bike rentals. 

## What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
The peak hours for bikes to get rented during the summer months is from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. These data points make sense, as people typically get to work around 9 a.m. and leave by 5:30 or 6 p.m. everyday. 

## Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
A large majority of the renters is male as they make up 60% of the ride count. If you look in the graph in sheet “Ride Count by Gender”, you can see that males are the ones who are primarily renting these bikes. 

## Which stations have the largest bike count for a starting journey? 
Grave St. Path and Hamilton Park are the two largest stations in regards to bike count. This is because of their location as they are the closest to Long Island in New York City.
