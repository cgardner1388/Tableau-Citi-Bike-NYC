## Background

*Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

## Data Manipulation

*Used the data from April 2019 and September 2015. I imported these CSV files into Tableau. I then joined these tables in tableau so I could start creating the various graphs and dashboards. 

## Analysis Summary

## Bike Rentals Based on Age
Based on the chart in sheet “Ride Count by Age”; people who are between the ages of 30 to 40 are renting the bikes the most out of all of the other age groups. The older the age, the lower the number of bike rentals.

## Peak Hours During Summer Months
The peak hours for bikes to get rented during the summer months is from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. These data points make sense, as people typically get to work around 9 a.m. and leave by 5:30 or 6 p.m. everyday.

## Gender Breakdown Active Participants
A large majority of the renters is male as they make up 60% of the ride count. If you look in the graph in sheet “Ride Count by Gender”, you can see that males are the ones who are primarily renting these bikes.

## Largest Bike Count by Station
Grave St. Path and Hamilton Park are the two largest stations baesd on bike count. This is because of their location as they are the closest to Long Island in New York City.
